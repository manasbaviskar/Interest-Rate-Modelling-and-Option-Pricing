# Interest-Rate-Modelling-and-Option-Pricing
This project focuses on interest rate modeling and option pricing using advanced numerical techniques. By implementing Monte Carlo simulations and finite difference methods, the project provides a robust framework for pricing bonds and options under various interest rate models, including Vasicek, CIR, and G2++.
